# 🏠 House Price Predictor - CodTech Internship Task 3

This is my final project for the **CodTech Internship**.  
In this project, I developed an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict California house prices and deployed the model using **Flask** as a web application.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Develop a complete data science project:
- Load and analyze California housing data
- Train a regression model
- Evaluate the performance
- Save the trained model
- Build a Flask web app for predictions

## 🧠 Model Summary

- **Algorithm**: RandomForestRegressor
- **Dataset**: California Housing Dataset (from sklearn)
- **Input Features**:  
  `MedInc`, `HouseAge`, `AveRooms`, `AveBedrms`, `Population`, `AveOccup`, `Latitude`, `Longitude`
- **Target**: Median House Price
